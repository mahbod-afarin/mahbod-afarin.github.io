An approach for reducing these overheads combines the use of a small proxy graph and the large original graph in a two phase query evaluation. The first phase evaluates the query on the proxy graph incurring low overheads and producing mostly precise results. The second phase uses these mostly precise results to bootstrap query evaluation on the larger original graph producing fully precise results. The effectiveness of this approach depends upon the quality of the proxy graph. Prior methods find proxy graphs that are either large or produce highly imprecise results. We present a new form of proxy graph named the Core Graph (CG) that is not only small, it also produces highly precise results. A CG is a subgraph of the larger input graph that contains all vertices but on average contains only 10.7% of edges and yet produces precise results for 94.5-99.9% vertices in the graph for different queries. The finding of such an effective CG is based on our key new insight, namely, a small subset of non-zero centrality edges are responsible for determining the converged results of nearly all the vertices across different queries. We develop techniques to identify a CG that produces precise results for most vertices and optimizations to efficiently compute precise results of remaining vertices. Across six kinds of graph queries and four input graphs, CGs improved the performance of GPU-based Subway system by up to 4.48×, of out-of-core disk-based GridGraph system by up to 13.62×, and of Ligra in-memory graph processing system by up to 9.31×.","tags":[],"title":" Core Graph: Exploiting Edge Centrality to Speedup the Evaluation of Iterative Graph Queries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abbas Mazloumi","Mahbod Afarin","Rajiv Gupta"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1702943879,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702943879,"objectID":"d3add9884cb225eb8d29157be1f8dd6a","permalink":"https://yuedong.netlify.app/publication/expressway-2023-bigdata/","publishdate":"2023-12-18T23:57:59.485338Z","relpermalink":"/publication/expressway-2023-bigdata/","section":"publication","summary":" Distributed Graph analytics is being widely used in various domains for analyzing large real-world graphs. There have been numerous efforts to build distributed frameworks for graph analytics aimed at improving scalability. These frameworks enable the processing of huge graphs that do not fit in the memory of a single machine by imposing message-passing overhead among a cluster of multiple machines, underutilizing the available computing resources. To mitigate this, we present Expressway, a technique to identify important edges, i.e., Highways, that play a key role in delivering the results for their boundary vertices. Expressway first runs the queries using only Highways, reducing the number of edges that needed to be processed during the execution of a graph query significantly. Thus, it can be accomplished in each machine separately in the cluster, avoiding the message-passing overheads. Then Expressway takes the results from running the query on Highways and initializes the vertices to these values, enabling faster convergence of graph algorithms. Our experiments show applying Expressway on the state-of-the-art frameworks results in up to speedup over the single-query framework and up to speedup over the framework to run a batch of concurrent graph queries.","tags":[],"title":" Expressway: Prioritizing Edges for Distributed Evaluation of Graph Queries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Gao","Mahbod Afarin","Shafiur Rahman","Nael Abu-Ghazaleh","Rajiv Gupta"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1701993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692403079,"objectID":"04630588d4e5ac58a1e2560e90786df6","permalink":"https://yuedong.netlify.app/publication/mega-2023-micro/","publishdate":"2023-08-18T23:57:59.485338Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mega-2023-micro/","section":"publication","summary":" Graph Processing is an emerging workload for applications working with unstructured data, such as social network analysis, transportation networks, bioinformatics and operations research. We examine the problem of graph analytics over evolving graphs, which are graphs that change over time. The problem is challenging because it requires evaluation of a graph query on a sequence of graph snapshots over a time window, typically to track the progression of a property over time. In this paper, we introduce MEGA, a hardware accelerator designed for efficiently evaluating queries over evolving graphs. MEGA leverages CommonGraph, a recently proposed software approach for incrementally processing evolving graphs that gains efficiency by avoiding the need to process expensive deletions by converting them into additions. MEGA supports incremental event-based streaming of edge additions as well as execution of multiple snapshots concurrently to support evolving graphs. We propose Batch-Oriented-Execution (BOE), a novel batch-update scheduling technique that activates snapshots that share batches simultaneously to achieve both computation and data reuse. We introduce optimizations that pack compatible batches together, and pipeline batch processing. To the best of our knowledge, MEGA is the first graph accelerator for evolving graphs that evaluates graph queries over multiple snapshots simultaneously. MEGA achieves 24 × -120 × speedup over CommonGraph.

In this scenario, a query typically needs to be applied to different snapshots of the graph over an extended time window, for example to track the evolution of a property over time. Solving a query independently on multiple snapshots is inefficient due to repeated execution of subcomputation common to multiple snapshots. At the same time, we show that using streaming, where we start from the earliest snapshot and stream the changes to the graph incrementally updating the query results one snapshot at a time is also inefficient. We propose CommonGraph, an approach for efficient processing of queries on evolving graphs.

To the best of our knowledge, JetStream is the first graph accelerator that supports streaming graphs, reducing the computation time by 90% compared with cold-start computation using an existing accelerator.
