## Graph Hardware Accelerators
- Graph hardware accelerators are specialized processors or systems designed to optimize and accelerate the processing of graph-based computations. These computations are essential in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, biological network analysis, and more. Traditional CPUs and GPUs, while powerful, are often not fully optimized for the irregular data structures and memory access patterns typical of graph processing. Graph hardware accelerators address these challenges by offering dedicated architectures that enhance memory bandwidth, reduce latency, and increase parallelism for graph traversal, node updates, and edge processing tasks. These accelerators can significantly boost the performance of graph analytics workloads, making them crucial for handling large-scale, dynamic graphs in real-time applications (Paper1: [JetStream](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3466752.3480126) - Paper2: [MEGA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3613424.3614260)).
  
## Static Graph Processing
- Static graph processing refers to the analysis and computation on graphs that remain unchanged during the entire processing period. In other words, the structure of the graph—comprising nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes)—is fixed and does not evolve as the processing occurs. This type of graph processing is used in scenarios where the graph data is collected at a specific point in time, and the relationships or connections within the graph do not need to be updated or altered during the analysis. Static graph processing is essential for various applications, such as computing shortest paths, detecting communities, finding cliques, and calculating centrality measures. These tasks rely on the stable structure of the graph, allowing for optimizations that can improve the efficiency of the analysis. Since the graph remains static, advanced techniques like precomputation, indexing, and parallel processing can be effectively employed to speed up the processing, making it well-suited for large-scale graph datasets that do not require real-time updates (Paper1: [Core Graph] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3627703.3629571) - Paper2: [JetStream](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3466752.3480126)).

## Dynamic Graph Processing
- Dynamic graph processing refers to the analysis and computation on graphs that change over time, with nodes and edges being added, removed, or updated during the processing period. Unlike static graphs, dynamic graphs reflect real-world scenarios where relationships and interactions are continuously evolving, such as social networks, communication networks, transportation systems, and biological networks. In dynamic graph processing, the goal is to efficiently handle these changes and update the analysis or computations accordingly without needing to recompute everything from scratch. This type of processing presents unique challenges because traditional algorithms and data structures optimized for static graphs may not efficiently handle the frequent updates characteristic of dynamic graphs. Techniques in dynamic graph processing often involve incremental algorithms that update results based on changes, rather than reprocessing the entire graph. Additionally, maintaining consistency and accuracy of the analysis in the face of continuous updates is crucial. Dynamic graph processing is vital for real-time applications, where timely insights are needed as the graph evolves, such as in real-time recommendation systems, fraud detection, and network monitoring (Paper1: [Common Graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3575693.3575713) - Paper2: [JetStream](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3466752.3480126)).
