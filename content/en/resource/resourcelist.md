## Graph Hardware Accelerators
- Graph hardware accelerators are specialized processors or systems designed to optimize and accelerate the processing of graph-based computations. These computations are essential in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, biological network analysis, and more. Traditional CPUs and GPUs, while powerful, are often not fully optimized for the irregular data structures and memory access patterns typical of graph processing. Graph hardware accelerators address these challenges by offering dedicated architectures that enhance memory bandwidth, reduce latency, and increase parallelism for graph traversal, node updates, and edge processing tasks. These accelerators can significantly boost the performance of graph analytics workloads, making them crucial for handling large-scale, dynamic graphs in real-time applications (Paper1: [JetStream](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3466752.3480126) - Paper2: [MEGA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3613424.3614260)).
