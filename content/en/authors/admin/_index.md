Hi, I am Mahbod, a Postdoctoral Scholar of Computer Science & Enginnering at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Tajana Šimunić Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/).  I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Univesity of Califronia, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Rajiv Gupta](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~gupta/) and Professor [Nael Abu-Ghazaleh](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~nael/). Prior to that, I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [Shaahin Hessabi](https://sharif.edu/~hessabi/). 

My research interests include graph processing algorithms and accelerators, computer architecture, and compiler optimizations. During my Ph.D., I developed frameworks that accelerate graph processing workloads by combining hardware and algorithmic innovations. These frameworks exploit parallelism and eliminate redundancy to improve scalability and performance. I also enjoy working on computer architecture and compiler optimization projects. My research has been published in top-tier conferences, including MICRO, ASPLOS, and EuroSys. Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading history and literature.

<!-- During my PhD, I am working on the [GRASP](http://grasp.cs.ucr.edu/) project in the Computer Architecture and Programming Systems (GRASP) Lab.
