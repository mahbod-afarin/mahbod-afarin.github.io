Hi, ID am Mahbod. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, San Diego, working in the [System Energy Efficiency (SEE) Lab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/) and the [Processing with Intelligence Storage and Memory (PRISM) Research Center](https://prism.ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Univesity of Califronia, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Rajiv Gupta](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~gupta/) and Professor [Nael Abu-Ghazaleh](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~nael/). Prior to that, I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [Shaahin Hessabi](https://sharif.edu/~hessabi/). 

My research interests include hardware accelerators, compiler optimizations, graph analytics, & computer architecture . During my Ph.D., I developed frameworks that accelerate graph processing workloads by combining hardware and algorithmic innovations. These frameworks exploit parallelism and eliminate redundancy to improve scalability and performance. I also enjoy working on computer architecture and compiler optimization projects. My research has been published in top-tier conferences, including MICRO, ASPLOS, and EuroSys. Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading history and literature.

<!-- During my PhD, I am working on the [GRASP](http://grasp.cs.ucr.edu/) project in the Computer Architecture and Programming Systems (GRASP) Lab.
