Hi, I am Mahbod Afarin, a PhD Candidate of computer science at [the University of California, Riverside](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rajiv Gupta](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~gupta/) and Professor [Nael Abu-Ghazaleh](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~nael/). I obtained my MSc in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Shaahin Hessabi](https://sharif.edu/~hessabi/). 

My research interests include graph processing algorithms and accelerators, computer architecture, and compiler optimizations. During my PhD, my work focuses on building frameworks that accelerate graph processing workloads from both a hardware and algorithmic perspective. These frameworks combine parallelism with a complementary approach that comprehensively reduces redundancy to enhance scalability and performance. I also enjoy working on computer architecture and compiler optimization projects. Beyond computer science, I like to read history and literature books.

<!-- During my PhD, I am working on the [GRASP](http://grasp.cs.ucr.edu/) project in the Computer Architecture and Programming Systems (GRASP) Lab.
